    This website is the geoportfolio of Ode Iou which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOMODO). The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of September 1994, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course. My geospatial-related interests is working with remote sensing data, collection and analysis of
		aerial-captured imagery, distribution modelling and creating 3D generations of models using spatial data. My current geospatial projects involve distribution 
		modelling of the flesh-footed shearwater bird species in the Recherche archipelago and assisting with the potential generation of a basic Digital Twin of
		Honiara using open-source data and programs.

		My own personal hobbies include jogging and travelling! More detailed information can be found in the About page!
